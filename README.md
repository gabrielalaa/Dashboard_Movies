# Dashboard Movies

This project represents the dashboard I built under the guidance of Dr. Johanna Schmidt at IMC University of Applied Sciences Krems.

My purpose was to gain interesting insights about the film industry, which has significantly grown. I first explored, cleaned, and prepared the dataset, looking for impactful information in a Jupyter Notebook.
I decided to also personalize the plots, using a visually pleasant color for the users.

Right after I discovered enough insights, more specifically four of them, I decided to create a separate file called `main.py`, in which I used **Dash** to create the dashboard itself.
You have to run this page in order to see the simplistic but consistent interface I prepared.
